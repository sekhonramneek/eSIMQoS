# Optimal Switching Behavior Evaluation for QoS-based Prepaid Pricing
Optimal Switching Behavior between QoS-based Mobile Prepaid Plans on E-SIM Support Subscriptions

---
This __*Optimal Switching Behavior Evaluation for QoS-based Prepaid Pricing*__ obtains the profits for personalized and traditional prepaid plans via a telecommunications provider, taking quality of service into consideration. The dataset has been anonymized and previous pre-processing to obtain the data were not uploaded to preserve confidentiality with the provider. Given the profits calculated based on a profit margin ranged from 0.02 to 0.15, the profit ratios are calculated for both expired and exhausted plans, demonstrating the potential increase in revenue a provider can make with personalized plans.

This evaluation is provided for prepaid plans on E-SIM support subscriptions and was developed for the research paper:
**On the Optimal Choice of QoS-Based Prepaid Cellular Plans on eSIM Capable Smartphones**
